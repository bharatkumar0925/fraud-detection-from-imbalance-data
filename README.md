# Fraud Detection System Using Ensemble Models

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a fraud detection system using ensemble modeling techniques. It focuses on detecting fraud in imbalanced datasets commonly encountered in credit card transactions.

## Features
- Utilizes RandomUnderSampler for handling class imbalance.
- Incorporates Isolation Forest anomaly scores as new features.
- Implements a VotingClassifier ensemble model using Random Forest classifiers.

## File Structure
- `credit-card-fraud-prediction/train.csv`: Training data file.
- `credit-card-fraud-prediction/test.csv`: Test data file.
- `main.py`: Python script containing the project code.
- `credit_prediction.csv`: Predictions saved in CSV format.
- `README.md`: Project documentation file (you are reading this).

## Setup Instructions
1. Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run `python main.py` to execute the project.
